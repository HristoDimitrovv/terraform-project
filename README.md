31. You must include installation and setup of the CloudWatch –êgent as part of the bootstrap
32. Export /var/log/messages to CloudWatch Logs
33. Export a custom metric for the memory and disk usage to CloudWatch
34. Create an auto scaling group placed in both AZs with min and max count equal to 2
35. Use the launch configuration in the auto scaling group 
36. You need to specify the load balancer in the definition of the auto scaling group
37. Create an SNS topic for alarm notifications
38. You need to manually subscribe your email address to the SNS topic
39. Create 3 CloudWatch Alarms based on metrics which should post to the SNS topic
40. Alarm for CPU usage above 80%
41. Alarm for disk usage above 80%
42. Alarm for memory utilization above 80%



### Execution plan ###

1. Clone the repository.
```hcl
git clone git@github.com:HristoDimitrovv/terraform-project.git
```
2. Deploy the Networking and Services part.
```hcl
cd /terraform-project/terraform/environment/Networking-Services
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply 
```
3. Uncomment the backend config found in "/providers.tf" and run again "terraform init" in order to sent the tfstate file to the S3 bucket (it will be used for data input in the application part). You can choose a name of the S3 bucket in the variables.tf file but you will need to specify it in the backend config here and in the application part.

4. Deploy the Application, DB and Monitoring part.
```hcl
cd /terraform-project/terraform/environment/Application-DB-Monitoring
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply 
```
5. Here again uncomment the backend config found in "/providers.tf" and run again "terraform init" in order to sent the tfstate file to the S3 bucket. Note that if you have changed the name of the S3 bucket found in the Networking and Services part, you will need to specify this name in the "providers.tf" file in the "backend s3" and also in the "data.tf" file in the "backend s3" part.
